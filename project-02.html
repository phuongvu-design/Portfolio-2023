            <p>With the advance of technology, smartphones have become a part of our life and help us achieve many things. I want to take this opportunity to help car owners schedule car service and maintenance right from their phones.

            <h3>Problem(s)</h3>
            <p>After interviewing a handful of people, I realized that people want to take better care of their cars so they can drive without any worry. When it comes to taking care of cars, car maintenance becomes a huge challenge for them. While it is easy to schedule a car service, most people do not know what they should do with cars due to limited access to service history, the lack of transparency, and solely relying on the mechanicals when they bring their cars to the service.

            <h3>Target customers</h3>
            <p>Customers who are passionate about bike riding, and are willing to spend a lot of money on their purchases. In addition, they think of it as an investment so they are very picky and do their research. The age range is 24 - 38. Approximately 72% are men.

            <p>Users browse the website and open many items pages but it is hard for them to decide which one is better to make a purchase decision. In this case, it would be nice if users can compare products to see which one best suits their needs.
            </p>
            <p>Most users do not like to go through the registration on the website to make a purchase. A guest checkout should be implemented to help users purchase without having to register for an account.

            <p>After I came to the solutions for this project in the previous step, I worked on user flow to shape my direction for the improved e-commerce website. This is to ensure that I understand each step the user is going through so that I can determine the most efficient routes.</p>

            <h3>Usability testing</h3>
            <p>Once I'm happy with my wireframe, I run a usability testing with several people to see if my project is heading in the right direction. The main objective of this testing is to find out if I have achieved the steps needed for users to complete their tasks which are comparing bikes to help make purchase decisions and check out as guests. Five participants in both online and offline environments run through the step and contributed valuable feedback to my project.

            <p>After feedback was collected during the 1st testing phase, I refined my wireframe in high fidelity. I also ran another usability testing round. Participants were able to complete the assigned tasks better. With the information gathered from many rounds of usability testing, I was able to make changes and refine the solutions.

            <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
            <p>This is an interesting project for me. I find out that mobile websites have many similarities with mobile applications. They are both built for smaller screens. Therefore the parts that can be put out on the screen are limited. I posed the question to myself asking how I could present enough information from a regular website on a small screen without compromising the looks and feels. It was also one of the most challenging tasks for me to complete in this project especially when I do the Bike comparison problem. This leads me to believe that limitations can be a great force for creativity!
