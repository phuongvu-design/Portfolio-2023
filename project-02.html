            <p>This app is designed to help car owners track and maintain their vehicles by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. It includes an easy to understand dashboard of the car's performance metric, a calendar of upcoming maintainance tasks and reminders.

            <h3>Problem(s)</h3>
            <p>After interviewing a handful of people, I realized that people want to take better care of their cars so they can drive without any worry. When it comes to taking care of cars, car maintenance becomes a huge challenge for them. While it is easy to schedule a car service, most people do not know what they should do with cars due to limited access to service history, the lack of transparency, and solely relying on the mechanicals when they bring their cars to the service.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>I interviewed a group of people to find out what they want to do with their cars when they are not driving. Both formal and informal one on one interviews were conducted to find out the issues car owners might have. There are many things they want to do with their cars, however taking care of their cars is their priority and they wish to have an alternative or a better way rather than relying solely on the car mechanic telling them what to do.

            <h3>Persona</h3>
            <p>Based on my research, I narrowed down the most important thing that car owners wanted to do and developed it into a user persona. This user persona presented target audiences and served as a guideline for this project. To tackle the problem that Steve had, I decided to create an app that helped Steve keep track of his car maintenance history and schedule the next car service. My goal was to design an app with easy navigation, clear action items, and an efficient process. It is worth taking into account that the user can be either a novice or very good at taking care of his/her car.</p>

            <h3>Solution(s)
            </h3>
            <p>Based on the research, I came up with a solution that helps car owners with their pain points. A car maintenance app will be designed. The app will help car owners keep track of their car maintenance service history as well as recommend what should be done on the next service schedule.

            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <p>It is essential to understand the user's pain points. Based on what I have researched so far and narrowed it down. I started with a “How might we” series of questions.
